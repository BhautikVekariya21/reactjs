# React Projects Repository

This repository contains multiple React projects that showcase various concepts and functionalities in React. Each project is designed to help beginners and experienced developers alike to learn and practice different aspects of building React applications. Below is a brief description of each folder and some helpful information on setting up and running the projects.

## Projects Overview

1. **01basicreact**: A simple React project demonstrating how to pass a variable name as props.
2. **01vitereact**: A React project set up with Vite, demonstrating the faster build times and improved developer experience using Vite bundler.
3. **02counter**: A basic counter application built with React.
4. **03tailwindprops**: An example project where React props are used along with Tailwind CSS for styling.
5. **04bgchanger**: A project that lets users change the background color with a click.
6. **05passwordgenerator**: A password generator application built using React.
7. **06currencyconverter**: A simple currency converter using React.
8. **07reactrouter**: A project demonstrating how to use React Router for navigation.
9. **08minicontext**: A mini project to demonstrate the use of React Context API for state management.
10. **09themeswitcher**: A project showcasing how to implement a theme switcher (light and dark mode).
11. **10todousecontext**: A to-do list application built with React and Context API.
12. **11reduxtoolkit**: A basic introduction to using Redux Toolkit for state management in React applications.

## Getting Started with the Projects

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: You can download and install it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: This comes pre-installed with Node.js. To check if npm is installed, run:
    ```bash
    npm -v
    ```
- **Git**: Install Git from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/) if you don't have it installed already.

### Setting Up a Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BhautikVekariya21/reactjs.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder (replace `project-name` with the specific folder you want to explore):
   ```bash
   cd reactjs/project-name
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the project (use Vite for projects that require Vite bundling):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   For non-Vite projects, use:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Using Vite for Development

Some of the projects in this repository are bundled using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a next-generation frontend tool that provides faster builds and an improved developer experience.

#### What is Vite?

Vite is a fast and lightweight build tool that significantly improves the development experience for modern JavaScript frameworks like React. It leverages native ES modules and bundles the code only when necessary, making the development process much faster.

#### Why Use Vite?

- **Faster Builds**: Vite improves the build speed compared to traditional bundlers like Webpack, especially in large projects.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Vite provides instant updates to the browser when code changes, allowing for real-time feedback without losing the application state.
- **Optimized for Production**: Vite optimizes the bundle for production with tree-shaking and other modern techniques to ensure a smaller, faster application.

For more information, you can visit the official [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

### Setting Up a Vite Project

To create a new Vite project from scratch:

1. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to set up your new Vite project.

3. Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd my-vite-project
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

For more information, visit the official [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
